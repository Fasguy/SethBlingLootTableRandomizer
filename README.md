# sb-ltr
A PHP port of SethBling's Loot-Table randomizer


Running version can be found here: ~~https://fasguy.net/sb_ltr_x/~~ (Will redirect to my new Randomizer)

If the website is not reachable, then wait a few minutes and try again.

## Info
This project has been replaced by [Fasguy/MinecraftRandomizer](https://github.com/Fasguy/MinecraftRandomizer).

This code may still be usable for recent versions of Minecraft, but it was only intended for 1.14.
